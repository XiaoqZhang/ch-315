# CH-315: Modeling lab

Welcome to CH-315! In this course you'll be introduced to the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/), molecular simulation techniques as well as to some general ideas about machine learning. 

## Setup
For this course, you'll only need a web browser as well as a stable internet connect. We will run all coding exercises using the [noto platform](https://www.epfl.ch/education/educational-initiatives/cede/digitaltools/jupyter-notebooks-for-education/).
